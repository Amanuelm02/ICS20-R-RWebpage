    <h1>Client Server vs Peer to Peer</h1>
    <h2> What are they?</h2>
    <p>Both peer-to-peer and client-server networks connect computers so that resources like files and applications can be shared. Peer-to-peer networks connect computers so that each computer shares all or part of its resources. Client-server networks have one or more central computers, or servers, that hold the data and manage resources.</p>
    <h2>Client Sever</h2>
    
    <li>Has a specific server and specific clients connected to the     server</li>
    <li>Shares the Information</li>
    <li>The client request for service and server respond with the     service</li>
    <li>The data is stored in a centralized server</li>
    <li>The client-server are expensive to implement</li>
    <li>Client-Server is more stable and scalable</li>
    <li>When several clients request for the services simultaneously, a server can get bottlenecked</li>
    
    <h2>Peer-to-Peer</h2>
    <li>Clients and server are not distinguished; each node act as client and server</li>
    <li>Each node can request for services and can also provide the services</li>
    <li>Each node can request for services and can also provide the services</li>
    <li>Connectivity</li>
    <li>Each peer has its own data</li>
    <li>Peer-to-peer are less expensive to implement</li>
    <li>Peer-toPeer suffers if the number of peers increases in the system</li>
    <li>As the services are provided by several servers distributed in the peer-to-peer system, a server in not bottlenecked</li>
